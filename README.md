- Go, Python, JavaScript and Solidity sometimes

Familiar Technologies:
- gRPC, Prometheus, Grafana, LXC

My Projects:
- Evolutionary Neural Network implementation called [CoSyNE](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/cosyne)
- [gym-rs](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/gym-rs) a pure Rust implementation of OpenAi's Gym environments
- Various technical trading indicators and signal processing funcions  in [Go](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/go_ehlers_indicators)
and [Rust](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/sliding_features-rs)
- [LFEST](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/lfest-rs) An embedded leveraged futures exchange for simulated trading, supporting external market data as well as market and limit orders with proper margining. With support for linear and inverse futures pnl calculation.
- [TradeAggregation](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/trade_aggregation-rs) for creating candles from tick data
- [TimeSeriesGenerator](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/time_series_generator-rs) for synthetic data generation

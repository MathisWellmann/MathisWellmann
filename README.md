### Welcome :wave:
Languages:
- Rust primarily as it's the best
- Go, Python, JavaScript but they are not much fun.

My Projects:
- Evolutionary Neural Network implementation called [CoSyNE](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/cosyne).
- [gym-rs](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/gym-rs) a pure Rust implementation of OpenAi's Gym environments.
- Various technical trading indicators and signal processing functions  in [Go](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/go_ehlers_indicators)
and [Rust](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/sliding_features-rs).
- [LFEST](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/lfest-rs) An embedded leveraged futures exchange for simulated trading, supporting external market data as well as market and limit orders with proper margining. With support for linear and inverse futures pnl calculation.
- [TradeAggregation](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/trade_aggregation-rs) for creating candles from tick data.
- [TimeSeriesGenerator](https://github.com/MathisWellmann/time_series_generator-rs) for synthetic data generation.
- Hydra, my private agent based trading framework for cryptocurrency perpetural future markets, and various other supporting code infrastructure like custom database, compression and exchange wrappers, that will remain private for the time being.

My Interests:
- Permissionless decentralized blockchain projects
- Low-latency algorithmic trading of cryptocurrency derivatives

### Welcome :wave:
I enjoy writing correct, fast and simple software using Rust 🦀 on NixOS.

Interested in predictable low latency trading systems, optimizing for CPU caches, branch predictors and proper atomics synchronization primitives.

[Using NixOS to manage my homelab](https://MathisWellmann/nixos-config) (6 servers, ~400 threads, ~1.7TB RAM) in a declarative and reproducible fashion, running various services, miners and ML-driven tick-by-tick backtests. Gotta pump that load average up. 
Also more than half of my contributions are directed towards my self-hosted forgejo instance, not showing up on Github.

### My Open-Source Repositories [Crates on lib.rs](https://lib.rs/~MathisWellmann):
